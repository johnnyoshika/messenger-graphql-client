# GraphQL Client

Client implementation for this 8 part tutorial: https://blog.apollographql.com/full-stack-react-graphql-tutorial-582ac8d24e3b

The tutorial is outdated, so I couldn't use the code provided verbatim with the latest versions of Apollo Server or Apollo Client, so I made the necessary changes for full compatibility with the latest libraries (as of this writing).

The server implementation of the same tutorial is available here: https://github.com/johnnyoshika/messenger-graphql
